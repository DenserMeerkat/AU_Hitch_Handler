## Features

- **Issue Reporting**: Students can easily report issues they encounter with the college administration.
- **Resolution Tracking**: The app tracks the progress of each issue to ensure it is resolved effectively.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design makes it easy for students to submit issues and track their status.

## How it Works

1. **Issue Submission**: Students submit their issues through the app, providing details about the issue they are facing.
2. **Resolution Process**: Domain administrators receives and reviews the issues, taking necessary actions to address them.
3. **Status Tracking**: Students can track the status of their issues within the app, ensuring transparency and accountability in the resolution process.

## How Administrators Manage Issues

Administrators have access to a dashboard where they can view all reported issues. They can review the details of each issue and set its status (e.g., pending, in progress, resolved). When administrators change the status of an issue, they can also add comments to provide updates or reasons for the status change. This communication feature ensures effective collaboration between administrators and students throughout the resolution process.

Students who raised the issue can provide feedback by giving a thumbs up or down if they agree with the resolution. This feedback mechanism helps administrators gauge student satisfaction and improve issue resolution processes.
